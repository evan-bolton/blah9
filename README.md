Towards aligning PubChem content with improving LLM utility and quality

Short Proposal Description:

Make concrete steps towards aligning PubChem biomedical data with improving LLM utility and quality with BLAH9 participants.  By doing the following: 
1. Align PubChem evidence content with PubAnnotation annotation data
2. Survey attendees on their LLM/ML/AI use cases and needs/desires to use curated content and knowledge graphs to prevent hallucinations and improve LLM utility/quality
3. Considering use of LLMs for scientific queries in PubChem  (transforming natural language questions into PubChem queries)
4. Work towards creation of a PubChem documentation chat-bot (specializing an LLM w/ PubChem documentation and publications)


Long Proposal Description:

Description:

Make concrete steps towards aligning PubChem biomedical data with improving LLM utility and quality with BLAH9 participants.  By doing the following: 
1. Align PubChem evidence content with PubAnnotation annotation data
   Arrange for an export into PubAnnotation a snapshot of PubChem content record links to publications in the appropriate schema format.  Work with PubAnnotation folks to achieve the import of desired content.  Discuss ways to maintain content as a function of time.  (E.g., yearly updates?  Incremental updates or full replacement?  etc.)
2. Survey attendees on their LLM/ML/AI use cases and needs/desires to use curated content and knowledge graphs to prevent hallucinations and improve LLM utility/quality
   Orally interview each team willing on how they use data from LLM creation to LLM result validation (e.g., to prevent hallucinations or undesired answer scope or etc.).  Summarize results and consider patterns of use cases and opportunities to provide for unmet needs.
3. Considering use of LLMs for scientific queries in PubChem  (transforming natural language questions into PubChem queries)
    Work with BLAH9 participants on ways to specialize LLMs to query PubChem.  Setup initial LLMs and query mechanisms.  Discuss plans for follow-on work (post BLAH9) to further the effort.
4. Work towards creation of a PubChem documentation chat-bot (specializing an LLM w/ PubChem documentation and publications)
    Work with BLAH9 participants to create a specalized LLM using content fro the PubChem documentation website and PubChem publications.  Demonstrate its use through a test suite of questions and evaluate the returned answers as appropriate.  Iterate on content specialization until desire quality is achieved.
